	abstract = {Spherical Harmonic Transforms (SHTs) which are essentially Fourier transforms on the sphere are critical in global geopotential
and related applications. Among the best known strategies for discrete SHTs are Chebychev quadratures and least squares. The
numerical evaluation of the Legendre functions are especially challenging for very high degrees and orders which are required
for advanced geocomputations. The computational aspects of SHTs and their inverses using both quadrature and least-squares
estimation methods are discussed with special emphasis on numerical preconditioning that guarantees reliable results for degrees
and orders up to 3800 in REAL*8 or double precision arithmetic. These numerical results of spherical harmonic synthesis and
analysis using simulated spectral coefficients are new and especially important for a number of geodetic, geophysical and
related applications with ground resolutions approaching 5 km.},

	abstract = {Associated Legendre polynomials and spherical harmonics are central to calculations in many fields of science and mathematics - not only chemistry but computer graphics, magnetic, seismology and geodesy. There are a number of algorithms for these functions published since 1960 but none of them satisfy our requirements. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of algorithms in the literature and, based on them, propose an efficient and accurate code for quantum chemistry. Our requirements are to efficiently calculate these functions for all non-negative integer degrees and orders up to a given number ({\textless}=1000) and the absolute or the relative error of each calculated value should not exceed 10E-10. We achieve this by normalizing the polynomials, employing efficient and stable recurrence relations, and precomputing coefficients. The algorithm presented here is straightforward and may be used in other areas of science.},
